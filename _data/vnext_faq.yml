    question: Where can I find the current (V1) and new (V2) LTS conformance criteria?
    answer: |
      
      The Zowe Squads have prepared XLS spreadsheets with conformance criteria for all Zowe
      extensions including: CLI, APIs, App Framework, and Explorerfor VS Code. The spreadsheets clearly show the prior /
      V1 criteria alongside the new / V2 criteria. Please be aware, there are additions, deletions, and CHANGES to the
      criteria. In some cases the change is simply that a BEST PRACTICE has been deemed REQUIRED. Use the light-GREEN
      highlights to easily identify the changes. See the [Changes to the Conformance Criteria](#conformance-changes) section at [Zowe.org/vNext](/vNext).

    question: Will my V1 conformant extension automatically work with V2?
    answer: |

      [Zowe.org/vNext](/vNext).

    question: Do I need to reapply for conformance?
    answer: |
      
      YES, we expect the Zowe V2 Conformance program to be available in early Feb 2022. We will

    question: What happens to my V1 conformance badge?
    answer: |
      
      All Zowe V1 conformance badges will remain at the Open Mainframe Project Interactive
      Landscape; we recommend documenting a Zowe compatibility matrix to ensure clients are aware of any/all
      compatibility issues between your V1 conformant apps and Zowe V2.

    question: What if my extension does not qualify for V2 conformance?
    answer: |
      
      You have several options:

      - Notify your customer base and advise them to remain on Zowe V1 LTS until
      you are able to make the necessary modifications to satisfy all of the new requirements (Note: extenders can
      choose NOT to be “day-1” V2 conformant )
      - Notify your customer base of V2 compatibility concerns (or lack thereof)
      and advise accordingly (e.g. extension operates but will not leverage V2 features etc.)
      - Replace your extension with a V2 conformant extension and indicate it as
      such

    question: Will there be a means to migrate (or convert?) existing / old-style profiles to the V2 team config for Zowe CLI? Will it handle profiles that are secured by SCS?
    answer: |
      
      Yes, we plan to introduce a "zowe config convert-profiles" command, which will be available in the v2 release.

  - number: 15
    question: Will (CLI)Daemon mode be integrated seamlessly into v2 and enabled by default?
    answer: |
      
      This work is still in progress-we are working on a "zowe daemon enable" command to make the daemon installation process as seamless as possible. Daemon mode will be disabled by default, the command must be run to enable it.

  - number: 16
    question: The V1 version of Zowe Explorer offers a text input area, where a user can enter some of the data / attributes (host, port, etc.) necessary to create the old-style profiles.  With Team Config what options are available for users to edit the config file?  Is it manual? Is there a UI?
    answer: |
      
      The recommended approach for editing the config file is to launch it in VS Code from Zowe Explorer and make modifications there. The designated user responsible for creating and maintaining the config (we recommend a team lead or Administrator) will be able to leverage the built-in “intellisense” when editing the file. *Note: **Team Config fundamentally changes the paradigm on profile creation & management.** Prior to Team Config, **all users** were required to understand, create, test, trouble-shoot, and manage their own profiles. Team Config was designed to scale all of these tasks back, remove the burden from individual users and centralize it. Once the config is distributed most users should not need to make any significant edits.*
